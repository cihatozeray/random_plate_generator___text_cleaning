# random_plate_generator___text_cleaning
Generates random vehicle license plates in accordance with Turkish regulations
Takes arguments [test_time], [test_letters], [test_numbers] (all optional) to test cleaning efficiency 
or execution time

-------

Generating random vehicle license plates are probably a common practice among programming courses

-------

In this example I researched constraints for license plates and I came across www.gib.gov.tr/plaka-harf-grubu 
(Turkish Republic Tax Administration website) which publishes those constraints for different provinces of Turkey

-------

Reads from .txt files which have unstructured data about license plate constraints. There are 81 files 
representing each province of Turkey

-------

String operations are used for data cleaning. No module was needed there 

-------

String and Random modules are imported only for plate generation
